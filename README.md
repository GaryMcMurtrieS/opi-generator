# OPI generation for CS-Studio and Phoebus

This repository is forked from [dls-controls/cssgen](https://github.com/dls-controls/cssgen/blob/master/README.md). After a throughly refactoring to support both CS-Studio and Phoebus, that is by writing one script for the OPI (.opi) file generation, which also supports the generation of a display (.bob) file for Phoebus, to minimal the effort of maintaining both platforms.
