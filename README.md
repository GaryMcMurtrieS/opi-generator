# OPI generation for CS-Studio and Phoebus

This repository is forked from [dls-controls/cssgen](https://github.com/dls-controls/cssgen/blob/master/README.md), and renamed to `opi-generator`, with the package name of `opigen`.

After a thorough refactoring process, `opigen` now supports OPI files generation for both CS-Studio and Phoebus from the same script, which minimizes the effort required to maintain both platforms, making it more efficient and streamlined.

## Installation

```
pip install opigen
```
